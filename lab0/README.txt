ECSE420 LAB0: Group 15, Sabina Sasu & Erica De Petrillo

Both our rectify.cu and pool.cu contain a main method, meaning that we cannot 
run both of them without commenting out the main method in one of the files first
(since they are in the same solution)

We also did not use 1 block as we saw on the Discussion board way after we were done
coding, for both of them we calculated an appropriate amount of blocks.
